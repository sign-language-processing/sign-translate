### Hearing Loss[^who]

The **World Health Organization (WHO)** estimates that globally, **1.5 billion people** live with some degree of hearing loss, a number expected to rise to **2.5 billion by 2050**.
Of these, **430 million people** experience disabling hearing loss, requiring rehabilitation to improve quality of life.
By 2050, this number is projected to grow to **700 million**.

::: info Quote: Relevance
Unaddressed hearing loss poses an annual global cost of US$ 980 billion.
This includes health sector costs (excluding the cost of hearing devices), costs of educational support, loss of productivity and societal costs.

### Deafness[^wfd]

Among those with disabling hearing loss, the **World Federation of the Deaf (WFD)** estimates there are approximately **70 million deaf people worldwide**.
This community spans over **200 sign languages**, underlining the linguistic diversity of deaf populations.
From our research, it is unclear how many people use sign languages.
