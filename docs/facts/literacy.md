# Spoken Language Literacy Among the Deaf

:::warning
This topic is controversial. There are opposing views on the causes and solutions to literacy challenges among the deaf.
It is important to approach it with sensitivity and respect.
We aim to provide a balanced view of the topic, and we welcome feedback and contributions.

There is a persistent literacy gap among the deaf population, though it is potentially solvable through tailored education approaches.
The underlying causes and solutions are debated, as a complex interplay of linguistic, educational, and systemic factors.
This document does not intend to provide a full historical overview of literacy among the deaf,
but rather to present a snapshot of the current state of the debate, to inform the reader.

## Challenges and Causes

The development of literacy in English or other spoken/written languages has long been a contentious issue.
Many deaf and hard-of-hearing (d/Deaf/hh) students do not achieve functional literacy upon graduating high school.[^ehelvetica]

The **Canadian Association of the Deaf (CAD)**[^cad] emphasizes that deafness itself is not the root cause of literacy challenges.
The CAD asserts that literacy problems can be mitigated through systemic changes in communication accessibility and education frameworks.

Linguistic deprivation plays a significant role in literacy challenges.[^harmreduction]
Research demonstrates that without a strong foundation in a first language, cognitive development and literacy suffer.
This leads to:

- Limited educational and career opportunities.
- Psychosocial harm from isolation and frustration.
- Impaired ability to express oneself or understand others.

## Statistics

In some regions, illiteracy rates among the deaf exceed **75%**[^iated], a statistic that reflects systemic inequities in education and access.
While this figure is debated, it underscores the urgency for inclusive solutions.

#### General Literacy[^ehelvetica]

- A significant proportion of d/Deaf/hh students do not meet literacy standards comparable to their hearing peers.
- **40–50%** of d/Deaf/hh children are estimated to have additional disabilities, further complicating literacy development.

#### Health Literacy[^pmc]

Low literacy rates among the deaf also result in poorer health literacy. Key findings include:

- **76%** of surveyed deaf adults were unaware of normal body temperature ranges.
- **41%** could not understand simple medical prescriptions.
- Only **20%** of deaf people are fluent in written English.

Communication barriers exacerbate these issues, particularly when health professionals rely on family members or interpreters, which can compromise privacy and autonomy.
